# 🪐 Hologram Bounce – Sci-Fi Ball Catching Game

**A visually rich, sci-fi-themed game where you catch falling colored balls using matching arcs inside a giant circle.**  

This is a canvas-based interactive project that combines motion, timing, and color-matching mechanics with glowing, particle-reactive visuals. Designed to look like a holographic interface, it’s part game, part art.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- A large **central circle** acts as the arena.
- **Colored balls** spawn inside the circle and fall downward.
- **Colored arcs** (segments of the big circle) rotate or wait at the bottom.
- Your goal: **Catch falling balls with the matching-colored arc.**
- Points are awarded for correct catches.
- Missed or mismatched catches lead to losing lifes(energy bars) till you lose.

## ✨ Features

- 🌌 **Sci-Fi Visuals**  
  A glowing holographic theme and collosion effects.

- 🎨 **Color Matching Mechanics**  
  Each falling ball is assigned a random color—only the matching arc will earn points.

- 🌀 **Reactive Particle System**  
  Visual particles trigger and react on collisions, giving a dynamic feel to every interaction.

- 🧠 **Skill-Based Catching**  
  Players must match color and time the arc positions correctly.

## 📐 How It Works

1. A random **ball** spawns in the center of the main circle and starts falling.
2. It is assigned a **random color**.
3. One of the arcs (or more) is also colored to match.
4. If the player positions or aligns the arc correctly, the ball **collides with it and is caught**.
5. Visual effects are triggered, and **score increases**.
